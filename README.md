# OpenAI Python API library

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/openai.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)

The OpenAI Python library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from any Python 3.7+
application. The library includes type definitions for all request params and response fields,
and offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients powered by [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx).

It is generated from our [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi) with [Stainless](https://stainlessapi.com/).
